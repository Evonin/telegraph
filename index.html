        Have you ever wanted to talk to people across the country? Well for $2000 and $0.74/word, you  can with the new invention called the Telegraph! This new invention uses electricity to create signals which travel between long distances. These signals can be translated into a language called morse code. For these signals to travel, the telegraph sends them through a series of wires. These wires are hung on the side of roads, which act like runways for your coordinated message.
    <h2>Who made this?</h2>
    <h3 id="h3">The telegraph was made by inventor, Samuel Morse. He is a professor of art at New York University and likes to invent new things for solving different problems. Before this he was a painter and always wanted to paint paintings at the US capital but hasn't been picked to attend.</h3>
