        Have you ever wanted to talk to people across the country? Well for $2000 and $0.74/word, you  can with the new invention called the Telegraph! This new system was created by Samuel Morse and it uses electricity to create signals, which travel between long distances. For this electricity to travel, the telegraph sends short pulses through a series of wires. Beside different roads and buildings, Morse is planning to add something called a telephone line, this wire will run throughout the country and sends each pulse of electricity to the desired destination.
